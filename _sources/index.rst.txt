.. tip::
   Eech materials database in the table below were calculated by using the `VASP <https://vasp.at/>`_ code based on a semi-automated high-throughput screening workflow as implemented into the `VASPKIT <http://vaspkit.com/>`_ code together with bash shell. The ﬁgures were generated by using the `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ code.

I. Computational 2D Semiconductor Database
------------------------------------------

Recently we perfomed high-throughput first-principles calculations to screen around 270 two dimensional nonmagnetic semiconductors from near 1000 monolayers according to the energetic, thermodynamic, mechanical, dynamic and thermal stability criterions. We presented the calculated results including lattice constants, formation energy, Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, shear modulus, band gap, band structure, ionization energy and electron affinity for all the candidates satisfying our criteria.
